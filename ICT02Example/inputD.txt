From Wikipedia
NetBeans is a software development platform written in Java. The NetBeans Platform allows 
applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules. Applications 
based on the NetBeans Platform, including the NetBeans integrated development environment (IDE), can 
be extended by third party developers.
The NetBeans IDE is primarily intended for development in Java, but also supports other languages, 
in particular PHP, C/C++ and HTML5.
NetBeans is cross-platform and runs on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris and other 
platforms supporting a compatible JVM.
The NetBeans Team actively support the product and seek feature suggestions from the wider 
community. Every release is preceded by a time for Community testing and feedback
